# **Introduction**

The "**life_expectancy_gdp.ipynb**" notebook contains all the information and code for the project.

<br>

The objective of this project was to analyze the **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)** and **Life Expectancy at Birth** across various countries, examining the relationship between a country's economic output and the average life expectancy of its population.

<br>

The dataset was curated by the **World Health Organization (WHO)** and the **World Bank Group (WBG)**. 

<br>

**Gross Domestic Product (GDP)** is a widely used economic indicator that measures the **total value of all goods and services produced within a country's borders over a specific time period**. 
<br>It serves as a key measure of a nation's economic activity and is commonly used to assess the overall health and growth of an economy.

<br>GDP takes into account the combined value of consumer spending, government expenditures, business investments, and net exports (exports minus imports). It provides insights into the size and performance of different sectors, such as agriculture, manufacturing, services, and construction, contributing to the overall economic output.
<br>It is typically measured in a country's national currency, such as dollars or euros, and is reported on a quarterly or annual basis. 
<br>**It enables policymakers, economists, and investors to monitor and analyze economic trends, make informed decisions, and compare the relative economic performance among different countries or regions**.

<br>

While GDP is a widely recognized metric, it has certain limitations. 
<br>It does not capture non-market activities, such as household production or volunteer work, and **may not fully reflect the well-being or distribution of wealth within a society**. 
<br>Therefore, it is often used in conjunction with other indicators, such as the **Life Expectancy at Birth (LEABY)**, to provide a more comprehensive assessment of a nation's overall development and standard of living.
